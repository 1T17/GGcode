"Ever struggled with writing G-code? Those endless lines of coordinates and commands that make your head spin? What if I told you there's a better way?"

"Traditional G-code is powerful, but it's like writing assembly language. GGcode changes everything - it's a high-level programming language that generates perfect G-code automatically."

"Watch this: I write a few lines of GGcode, hit compile, and instantly get professional G-code with 3D visualization. No more manual coordinate calculations!"


"GGcode is a programming language specifically designed for CNC machining. It gives you variables, loops, functions, and all the programming tools you love, but outputs perfect G-code."

"Instead of writing G1 X25 Y30, you write G1 X[x] Y[y] where x and y are variables. Need to change the size? Just update one variable, and the entire program updates automatically."

"See how clean this is? Variables for radius and center position, mathematical calculations, and clear comments. This is what modern G-code generation looks like."


"Let's start with the basics. Here I define variables for radius, center position, and feed rate. Now I can use these anywhere in my program."

"Need to calculate a position? Just use math: center_x plus radius, or multiply by PI. GGcode handles all the calculations for you."

"Change the radius from 25 to 50, and every circle in your program updates instantly. No more hunting through hundreds of lines to update coordinates!"

"Now for the magic - loops! This simple for loop creates a 12-pointed star pattern. Each iteration calculates a new angle and position."

"Watch as GGcode generates all 12 points automatically. What would take 36 lines of traditional G-code is just 6 lines here."





"And here's the result - a perfect geometric pattern. Want 24 points instead? Just change the loop count. The math handles everything else."

"GGcode supports all G-code arc commands. G2 for clockwise arcs, G3 for counter-clockwise. Use radius or I,J offsets - your choice."

"Combine loops with arcs, and you get smooth spirals. This creates a beautiful spiral pattern using G2 arcs with calculated centers."

"See how smooth these curves are? Each arc segment is perfectly calculated, giving you professional-quality tool paths."

"But here's where GGcode really shines - the Configurator Modal. Add special comments to your variables, and they become interactive controls."

"Watch this: I change the number of teeth from 24 to 36, and the entire gear updates in real-time. No recompiling, no waiting."

"Adjust module size, pressure angle, feed rate - everything updates instantly. This is parametric design made simple."

"Let's see some real examples. This simple circle program uses variables for radius and center. Clean, readable, and reusable."

"Compile it, and you get perfect G-code with proper feed rates and safe heights. Ready to run on any CNC machine."

"Here's a flower pattern using loops and trigonometry. Each petal is calculated using sine and cosine functions."

"Complex geometry, simple code. This would be nearly impossible to write by hand in traditional G-code."

"This spiral uses G2 arcs with calculated centers. Smooth, continuous motion that's perfect for engraving or cutting."

"Professional-quality spirals with just a few lines of code. The math handles all the complex calculations."

"And here's a professional gear generator with involute tooth profiles. This creates gears that actually work together."

"Use the configurator to adjust teeth count, module size, pressure angle. Real-time updates show exactly what you'll get."

"Multiple depth passes ensure clean cuts. This is production-ready G-code for professional machining."

"GGcode includes all the math functions you need: sine, cosine, square root, power, and more. Plus built-in constants like PI and TAU."

"Arrays let you store and manipulate data. Perfect for complex patterns or when you need to process multiple values."

"Built-in error checking catches common mistakes. No more mysterious G-code errors that crash your machine."

"Here's the complete workflow: Write GGcode in the editor, adjust parameters in the configurator, generate G-code automatically, visualize in 3D, and export for your machine."

"Every change updates the visualization instantly, like having a real-time preview of your machine's future. See exactly what your machine will do before it does it - no surprises!"

"One click exports perfect G-code. No manual editing, no coordinate calculations, no existential crises. Just professional results that make you look like a genius."

"GGcode transforms complex G-code generation into simple, readable programming that actually makes sense. Write once, use many times with different parameters - it's like having a G-code template library that actually works."

"Perfect for CNC machining, 3D printing, laser cutting, and any application that needs precise tool paths without the headache. It's like having a programming language that speaks machine."

"Ready to revolutionize your G-code workflow and finally understand what you're doing? Download GGcode today, try the examples, and join our community of makers and engineers who've seen the light."

"Find documentation, examples, and support at our website. Share your creations and help others discover the power of GGcode. Because the world needs more people who can program machines without losing their sanity."

"Thanks for watching, and happy machining! May your G-code always be clean and your cuts always be precise!"
